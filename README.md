# William and Mary Dissertation Template
This dissertation template is not intended to be a source of truth. Instead, it should be updated as requirements/compliance demands. Some lines of code (especially in `WM-*` files) are hardcoded and could be improved.

## Using `make`
The whole dissertation can be built simply by typing `make` at the command line. Auxiliary files can be removed by typing `make clean`.
